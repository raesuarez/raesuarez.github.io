Welcome all!

# Thank you for visiting!

Hello all! I'm Rachel, a rising junior at Wellesley College studying Computer Science. Before starting at Wellesley, I had ZERO experience in Computer Science, but I was very interested in video game development. Since then, I have taken various CS classes that have challenged and inspired me to explore different fields, as well as classes and research related to video game design.

Currently, I am doing research at Carnegie Mellon University through the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE) program, studying the sustainability of open source communities. I am also a participant in the IBM Accelerate program under the Software Engineering track. 

I am looking for internships and opportunities in Game Development and Software Engineering (and related fields) for Summer 2024. I have experience in video game development and software engineering!

Please feel free to browse the rest of my website to find my previous projects. Thank you for visiting my site and I hope to hear from you soon!
