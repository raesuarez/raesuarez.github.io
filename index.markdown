# Welcome to my portfolio!

Hello all! My name is Rachel Suarez and welcome to my website! I am a rising junior at Wellesley College studying Computer Science. I am mainly interested in video game development and computer networks. I have experience in video game design and research, as well as beginner skills in software engineering. 

Currently, I am doing research at Carnegie Mellon University through the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE) program, studying the sustainability of open source communities. I am also a participant in the IBM Accelerate program under the Software Engineering track. 

I am looking for internships and opportunities in Game Development and Software Engineering (as well as related fields) for Summer 2024. 

Please feel free to browse the rest of my website to find my previous projects. Thank you for visiting my site and I hope to hear from you soon!
